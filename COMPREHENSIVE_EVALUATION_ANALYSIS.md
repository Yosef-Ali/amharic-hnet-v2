## Conclusion

The Amharic H-Net v2 model demonstrates promising cultural safety compliance and technical architecture, but requires significant accuracy improvements before production deployment. The perfect cultural safety score (100%) and excellent Ge'ez script handling provide a strong foundation for further development.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with enhanced training regimen while maintaining current cultural safety standards. The model architecture is sound and scalable, requiring primarily data and training improvements rather than fundamental redesign.
