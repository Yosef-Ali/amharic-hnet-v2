## Code Style & Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for all Python code
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Include docstrings for all classes and functions
- Use descriptive variable names with cultural context awareness

### Cultural Safety Requirements
- All text processing must respect Ethiopian and Eritrean cultural contexts
- Sacred terms (መስቀል, እግዚአብሔር, ቡና ceremony) require special handling
- Historical references (ቀዳማዊ, ላሊበላ) must be contextually appropriate
- Multi-dialect sensitivity across Ethiopian/Eritrean/Regional variants

### Testing Standards
```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Test morpheme processing
python tests/test_morphemes.py

# Validate cultural safety
python -m src.safety.cultural_guardrails
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **GPU Memory**: Use smaller batch sizes in configs/config.yaml
- **Cultural Safety Violations**: Check src/safety/cultural_guardrails.py for protected terms
- **Morpheme Segmentation**: Validate input text has >70% Amharic characters
- **Agent Failures**: Check that input/output directories exist and have proper permissions

### Agent-Specific Debugging
- **data-collector**: Verify internet connection and Wikipedia API access
- **linguistic-analyzer**: Check that data/raw contains valid JSON corpus files
- **training-engineer**: Ensure CUDA available for GPU training, check configs/config.yaml
- **evaluation-specialist**: Verify model checkpoints exist in outputs directory
- **deployment-engineer**: Check port availability and model file permissions

## Smart Agentic Development Principles
- This project represents **paradigm shift** from traditional monolithic AI development
- **Domain Expert Agents**: Each agent has deep specialized knowledge vs generalist approach
- **Compound Quality Effect**: Sequential quality improvements create exponential results
- **Cultural Safety Integration**: Revolutionary approach - embedded at every stage, not afterthought
- **Claude Code Native**: Follows official best practices with single-responsibility design
- **Limited Tool Access**: Each agent has precisely the tools needed for security and performance
- **Version Controlled Workflows**: Agent definitions in `.claude/` enable reproducible, collaborative development
- **Knowledge Amplification**: System provides expertise that would take years for individual developer to acquire

## Commands to Remember
- Use `Task(...)` for all agent invocations
- Each agent has specific constraints and success criteria
- Sequential workflow: data-collector → linguistic-analyzer → training-engineer → evaluation-specialist → deployment-engineer
- Parallel processing available for data collection and architecture design
- Traditional CLI still available for direct model operations

This file serves as the persistent memory for Claude Code when working on Amharic H-Net v2, demonstrating how **smart agentic development workflows** create the gold standard for culturally-aware AI development. This approach should become the model for all multilingual AI projects requiring cultural sensitivity and technical excellence.

**🇪🇹 This system represents the future of AI development - collaborative, specialized, and culturally responsible.**
