    ðŸŽ¯ MORPHEME BOUNDARY TUNING RESULTS:
    
    Optimal Threshold: 0.5
    
    NEXT STEPS:
    1. Modify AmharicMorphemeChunker to use threshold 0.5
    2. Retrain model with morpheme boundary supervision
    3. Focus training on morphologically rich Amharic sentences
    4. Validate against linguistic morpheme patterns
    
    ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT:
    - Current model over-segments (too many boundaries)
    - Need better morphological pattern learning
    - Consider adding morpheme-level loss function
